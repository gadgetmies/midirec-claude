# Deviations from the prototype

Every place where the codebase chose differently than `design_handoff_midi_recorder/prototype/`. Each item lists the rationale, where it lives in the codebase, and a recommendation on whether to back-port to the design source.

## 1. `--mr-note-sel` token value — warm orange-red instead of light blue

**What changed**: `src/styles/tokens.css` overrides `--mr-note-sel` to `oklch(72% 0.18 30)` (a warm orange-red). The upstream `design_handoff_midi_recorder/prototype/tokens.css` value is `oklch(82% 0.14 240)` — a light blue.

**Why**: The README §Design Tokens describes `--mr-note-sel` as *"selected note (warm orange-red)"*, and `screenshots/04-marquee-selection.png` renders selected notes in warm orange-red. The upstream token value contradicts both the README description and the screenshot. The codebase's local override aligns with the documented design intent.

**Where**: `src/styles/tokens.css` lines around the `--mr-note` block, with an explicit deviation comment.

**Recommendation**: Back-port to `design_handoff_midi_recorder/prototype/tokens.css` (change the value to `oklch(72% 0.18 30)` or another warm orange-red the design owner picks). Once back-ported, the codebase removes its deviation comment and resumes pure sync.

**Status**: deviation — awaiting design source fix.

## 2. Marquee corner markers removed

**What changed**: The four `.mr-marquee__corner` squares (positioned at `tl/tr/bl/br` of the marquee rectangle in the prototype) are no longer rendered. The marquee is just a dashed-stroke rectangle with the `7 SELECTED` badge alongside.

**Why**: Design owner request after visual review — the corner squares added clutter without adding signal beyond what the dashed border already conveys. Removing them simplifies the visual.

**Where**:
- JSX: `src/components/piano-roll/PianoRoll.tsx` — `.mr-marquee__corner` elements not rendered.
- CSS: `src/components/piano-roll/PianoRoll.css` — `.mr-marquee__corner` rules removed.

**Recommendation**: Back-port to `prototype/components.jsx` and `prototype/app.css` — remove the corner markers from the prototype's marquee component. Update screenshot 04 to match if regenerated.

**Status**: confirmed by design owner — back-port pending in next inbound bundle.

## 3. Marquee marching-ants animation — SVG `stroke-dashoffset` instead of CSS `background-position`

**What changed**: The marquee in the codebase is an `<svg>` containing a `<rect>` with `stroke-dasharray: 4 4` and an `animation` on `stroke-dashoffset` (0 → -8 over 0.8s linear infinite). The prototype is a `<div>` with `border: 1px dashed var(--mr-accent)` and an `animation: mr-marquee-march 0.8s linear infinite` that animates `background-position`.

**Why**: The prototype's animation has no visible effect — `background-position` only moves a repeating-pattern fill, but the marquee's `background` is a flat-color `color-mix()`, not a pattern. There's nothing for `background-position` to move, so the dashes never march. SVG `stroke-dashoffset` is the standard CSS-only way to actually animate dashed strokes.

**Where**:
- JSX: `src/components/piano-roll/PianoRoll.tsx` — the marquee renders as `<svg className="mr-marquee">` containing a `<rect className="mr-marquee__rect">`.
- CSS: `src/components/piano-roll/PianoRoll.css` — `.mr-marquee__rect` carries the dashed-stroke + animation.

**Recommendation**: Back-port to the prototype. The prototype's animation is broken; SVG with stroke-dashoffset is the right technique. Tradeoff: the DOM element type changes from `<div>` to `<svg>` — minor.

**Status**: deviation — fixes a latent bug in the prototype.

## 4. Ruler keys-column offset — JSX per-tick, not CSS `padding-left`

**What changed**: The Ruler's tick and label children are positioned at `left: KEYS_COLUMN_WIDTH + i * pxPerBeat` in JSX, where `KEYS_COLUMN_WIDTH = 56`. The original instinct was to put `padding-left: 56px` on the `.mr-ruler` element in CSS.

**Why**: CSS `padding-left` does not shift absolutely-positioned descendants — they're positioned relative to the parent's *padding box*, whose left edge is at the inner edge of the border. So absolute children with `left: 0` would still land at the visible left edge regardless of padding. Computing the offset in JSX is the only way to actually shift the ticks.

**Where**: `src/components/ruler/Ruler.tsx` — `KEYS_COLUMN_WIDTH = 56` constant; tick/label `left` includes the offset.

**Recommendation**: No back-port needed. The prototype's `Ruler` component doesn't apply this offset at all (it lets ticks span the full passed `width`, including over the keys column area). The codebase's offset is an intentional improvement so beat-0 in the Ruler aligns with beat-0 in the lane area below. Document as an enhancement.

**Status**: improvement — codebase is more correct than prototype.

## 5. Fixed-zoom rendering — constant `pxPerBeat` × `rowHeight`

**What changed**: The PianoRoll and Ruler render at fixed pixel sizes derived from constants `DEFAULT_PX_PER_BEAT = 88` (px per beat) and `DEFAULT_ROW_HEIGHT = 14` (px per pitch row). The piano roll is `KEYS_COLUMN_WIDTH + totalT * pxPerBeat` × `range * rowHeight` pixels. The viewport's center column may be wider or narrower than the piano roll; `.mr-center { overflow: hidden }` clips the fixed-size content at the column boundary.

The prototype's renderer takes `width` and `height` props and resizes responsively to fit them.

**Why**: Responsive resizing introduces ResizeObserver lag (renderer measures, then re-renders, then layout settles) and races during interactive resize where stale prop values force the renderer wider than its allocated column, overlapping the inspector. Fixed zoom decouples the renderer's intrinsic size from the viewport, making the layout robust at any window size. Horizontal/vertical scrolling to navigate a roll wider/taller than the viewport is a deliberately deferred concern — it's the right next step but isn't required for Slice 2 acceptance.

**Where**:
- Constants: `src/components/piano-roll/PianoRoll.tsx` exports `KEYS_COLUMN_WIDTH`, `DEFAULT_PX_PER_BEAT`, `DEFAULT_ROW_HEIGHT`.
- Renderer: PianoRoll and Ruler compute their own widths/heights from those constants. No `useElementSize` / `ResizeObserver` involved.
- Layout shell: `.mr-shell`, `.mr-body`, `.mr-center` all carry `min-width: 0` + `overflow: hidden` to contain the fixed-size renderer.

**Recommendation**: Confirmed by design owner — fixed-zoom rendering is the chosen approach. Horizontal/vertical scrolling is a deliberately deferred concern for a later slice. The prototype's measure-based mock can stay as-is (it's a design canvas, not production), but Slice 6+ design refreshes should assume fixed zoom + scroll/zoom UI.

**Status**: confirmed by design owner — fixed zoom is the model.

## 6. Ruler `5.1` label removed

**What changed**: For a 16-beat view (`totalT = 16`), the Ruler renders major labels `1.1`, `2.1`, `3.1`, `4.1` — but NOT `5.1` (the start of bar 5). The prototype's `Ruler` component would emit a `5.1` label at i=16.

**Why**: Bar 5 starts AT the very right edge of a 4-bar window. The `5.1` label, even if positioned correctly, falls outside the visible area (clipped by `.mr-ruler { overflow: hidden }`). And conceptually the labels should mark the start of each bar that has CONTENT visible — bar 5 has no content because the window only extends to beat 16. So we suppress the label at `i === totalT`.

**Where**: `src/components/ruler/Ruler.tsx` — label rendering condition is `major && i < totalT`.

**Recommendation**: Back-port to the prototype's `Ruler` component (suppress label at the trailing tick). Minor change.

**Status**: deviation — small bug fix.

## 7. AppShell layout — explicit grid `minmax(0, 1fr)` and `overflow: hidden`

**What changed**: `.mr-shell` has `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr)` plus `overflow: hidden`. `.mr-body` has `grid-template-columns: var(--mr-w-sidebar) minmax(0, 1fr) var(--mr-w-inspector)` (explicit `minmax(0, ...)` for shrinkability) plus `overflow: hidden`. `.mr-center` has `min-width: 0` plus `overflow: hidden`. `.mr-stage` has `min-width: 0`.

The prototype's `app.css` `.mr-app` uses plain `1fr` columns and no `overflow: hidden` on these containers.

**Why**: With plain `1fr`, the column's implicit `min-width: auto` resolves to its content's min-content width, which is large (the titlebar's transport bar is several hundred pixels of intrinsic min-content). That auto-expanded column then sizes the body grid, pushing fixed-pixel columns past the viewport edge when the window narrows. Explicit `minmax(0, 1fr)` lets the `1fr` actually shrink to 0. `overflow: hidden` on the cascade containers (shell/body/center) contains the fixed-zoom renderer at the column boundary regardless of any one-frame resize-observer lag.

**Where**: `src/components/shell/AppShell.css`.

**Recommendation**: Back-port to `prototype/app.css`. The prototype currently doesn't surface the bug because the design canvas always renders at fixed pixel sizes (no responsive resize), but the underlying CSS will misbehave once the prototype gets a real responsive viewport. Worth fixing upstream.

**Status**: improvement — codebase is more robust.

## 8. CC lane solo composition — lane-scoped, not stage-wide

**What changed**: The `data-soloing` flag on `.mr-cc-lanes` is derived from `lanes.some(l => l.soloed)` — only CC-lane solos. CC-lane solos do NOT dim non-soloed track rows in the multi-track stack above; track-row solos do NOT dim non-soloed CC lanes below. The two solo groups are independent.

The prototype's `Stage` computes a single `stageSoloing = anySolo || anyDJSolo || anyCCSolo` flag set on the stage wrapper, so a CC-lane solo dims everything (tracks too) and vice versa.

**Why**: Our shell architecturally separates `.mr-stage` (multi-track stack) from `.mr-cc-lanes` (CC block) — they're sibling grid rows in `.mr-center`, not nested. Sharing `data-soloing` would require lifting it to a common ancestor (e.g., `.mr-center`) and broadening every solo-composition CSS selector across two capability stylesheets. Keeping the solo groups independent keeps the `tracks` and `cc-lanes` capabilities self-contained for Slice 4. Switching to stage-wide later (probably with Slice 7's DJ units) is a one-file refactor.

**Where**:
- `src/components/cc-lanes/CCLanesBlock.tsx` — `data-soloing` derived from `lanes` only.
- `src/components/cc-lanes/CCLane.css` — `[data-soloing="true"] [data-soloed="false"] .mr-cc-lane__plot` selector scoped to within `.mr-cc-lanes`.
- `src/components/tracks/MultiTrackStage.tsx` — `data-soloing` derived from `tracks` only (existing).

**Recommendation**: Defer until Slice 7 lands. Once DJ units (`.mr-unit__rows`) need to participate in solo composition too, lift `data-soloing` to a shared wrapper around the stage and CC block, and rewrite the three composition rules (`.mr-track__roll`, `.mr-cc-lane__plot`, `.mr-unit__rows`) to share that ancestor.

**Status**: deviation — pragmatic for Slice 4, revisit at Slice 7.
